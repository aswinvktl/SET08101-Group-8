    <h1>ðŸ“ƒ FAQ: Behind the Scenes of <em>The King of Bruhaven</em></h1>
    <p>Welcome to the official FAQ and behind-the-scenes of your narrative game, <em>Loch Ness Monster: Expedition</em>. Below you'll find answers to the most frequently asked and deeply considered questions about the story, mythology, characters, and creative inspirations.</p>
    <hr>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why is the Queen described with blue eyes and brown hair?</h3>
        <p>In Edinburgh, over 57% of people have blue eyes and brown is the most common hair color. That combination struck me visually when I first arrived. It became a symbol of local beauty and identity. The Queen represents the everyday elegance I saw in real Scottish people.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why is the King emotionally soft and gentle?</h3>
        <p>I wanted to show a version of masculinity that is noble, protective, but not aggressive. He leads with love and loyalty. He's a warrior when needed, but he's primarily a human being who feels, supports, and listens.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why a dog named Haggis?</h3>
        <p>Haggis is inspired by Greyfriars Bobby, the famous loyal Skye Terrier from Edinburgh. I wanted to turn a cultural icon into an emotional anchor. He's named 'Haggis' for warmth and charm â€” something unmistakably Scottish.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why does Haggis become a Highland Bull?</h3>
        <p>It symbolizes Scottish strength. Highland cows are iconic here. I had never heard of a Highland bull, so I thought creating one with fire horns would make it feel even more fantastical.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's in the bag and why?</h3>
        <p>The bag contains Iron Brew, shortbread, her cloak, her journal, candles, and a stock-and-horn. It represents Scotland through the eyes of a foreigner. Each item symbolises comfort, culture, memory, or survival.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why do dwarves and fog offer different paths?</h3>
        <p>The dwarves represent wisdom, community, and rest. The fog represents grief, loneliness, and emotional reflection. Players are tested to choose comfort vs. solitude.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why a granny dwarf with riddles?</h3>
        <p>She adds warmth, familiarity, and Scottish folklore charm. Her riddle also has meaning later, so she isn't just comic relief.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why do selkies appear as the Queen?</h3>
        <p>Selkies are Scottish mythological creatures. I wanted to introduce local folklore and show how grief makes us believe what we want to see. It's an emotional test.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why do puzzles appear?</h3>
        <p>The Queen is a scholar. She leaves behind stories and riddles. Solving puzzles is about proving you understand and respect her mind, not just loving her presence.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Who are the Blue Men of the Minch?</h3>
        <p>A lesser-known Scottish sea myth. They test the King's intellect with rhyme and challenge, as a metaphor for facing foreign places with humility.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why the unicorn?</h3>
        <p>The unicorn is Scotlandâ€™s national animal. It's strange and magical. It doesn't speak or fight; it guides. It rewards the player for patience and trust.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why is the glowing map a trap?</h3>
        <p>It was given in a dream, vague and hypnotic. It's a trap for players who rely on tools instead of instinct or emotion. The wrong path leads to grief and loss.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why include her voice as a trap?</h3>
        <p>It challenges emotional impulse. Not everything that sounds like love is safe. The King must trust what he's learned, not just what he hears.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why end at Loch Ness?</h3>
        <p>It's the most famous myth tied to Scotland. The monster is real but not evil. It symbolizes nature, fate, and myth itself.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why not kill the monster?</h3>
        <p>Players get a choice. Mercy is the noble path. The Queen offers a non-violent solution. It emphasizes emotional maturity and the value of compassion.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why does the Queen use a book to end it?</h3>
        <p>She's a scholar. It's about knowledge, heritage, and ancient language. The monster dissolves into mist not death, just transformation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why does Haggis return in the end?</h3>
        <p>Because hes family. Heâ€™s the storyâ€™s soul. No fantasy journey is complete without returning to the love that carried you.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why no throne room, no celebration?</h3>
        <p>Because peace is the real ending. No crown, no gold. Just going home. Just being together.</p>
