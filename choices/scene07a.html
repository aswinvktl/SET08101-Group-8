    <h4>Follow the unicorn</h4>
    <p>You follow it, you pass a valley of magic, a valley full or colour and light, something that is a rare sight. You witness herds of unicorns, playing jumping, highland coos enjoying their time, it looks surreal. 

        You keep following the unicorn, Haggis barks joyfully. You havent seen him this happy
        
        Unicorn leads you to two standing stones, onto the edge of loch ness.
        
        Your sword glows very much, you know the monster is nearby. You hear growls and the air smells of smoke, the same smoke from your village. 
        
        You look up, and the unicorn is gone, it got you where you wanted to be. 
        
        The night is slowly falling, but the moon is still not fully up. You have time.
        
        Then you move forward.
