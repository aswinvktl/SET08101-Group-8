    <h4>The blue men of the minch</h4>

    <p>The gate fades behind you.

        The ship moves forward and the sun decides to rest beside horizon. 
        
        You camp. you have some food and find a fiddle(scottish violin) and start playing the songs - like your wife taught, thinking of her. 
        
        You look at moon, tomorrow is the night, when the moon turns full and blue. 
        
        You go to sleep, ready for tomorrow
        
        You start sailing early in the morning, even before the sun minds to show up. 
        
        The ship moves forward. You pick up some pace. You are close. 
        
        Suddenly, something happens in the water. Haggis growls and barks, not scared, but just….. a warning
        
        You reach for your sword.
        
        Some figures rise, some blue, thin human like beings. Their eyes have a distinct glow to them. They look human, they could be. Who knows
        
        Their leader steps up and speaks
        
        “Traveler bold, whose path is bent,
        
        The loch has judged your firmament.
        
        Answer true, or sink like stone 
        
        Speak what’s known, or sail alone”
        
        You remember the tales
        
        The Blue men of the minch - sea spirits who test those who pass. Tricksters, judges. 
        
        Now they offer you riddles and knowledge
        
        If you solve their riddle, you will get a magical object, some wisdom and direction
        
        If you fail, you can fight them, but they’ll drown you, that’s what they do 
        
        Or you can try to steer away, hoping they’ll leave you alone
        
        You have to choose
    </p>

    <p>a. Solve their riddle</p>
    <p>b. fight them</p>
    <p>c. steer away</p>
