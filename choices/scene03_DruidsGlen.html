    <h4>THE DRUID'S GLEN</h4>
    <p>The sun is barely looking up the horizon.

        You glide the ship forward. The mist parts to reveal a secret forest, trees arched like a cathedral
        
        You look at your map, as it was glowing. 
        
        It's the Druid's glen. The Druids - you remember from the tales - the ancient priests with magic and power- there might be clues here perhaps. the air smells odd. You see ancient ruins and rotten bones. Perhaps some rituals.
        
        You look at her books, you see them glowing: 
        
        “The glen listens and holds magic. 
        
        If I am ever lost, I might be somewhere mystical”
