    <p>The map glows insistently. You trust it.

        But it was never finished.
        
        It loops you in circles.
        
        The loch coils like a serpent.
        A whirlpool forms.
        The boat spins.
        
        The stars shift. The night passes.
        
        By the time you find land again â€” the moon has turned blue.
        
        You are too late.
        
        The Queen is gone.
