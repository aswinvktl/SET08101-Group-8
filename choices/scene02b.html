    <h4>The ruins</h4>
    <p>You chose to go right</p>
    <div class="background" style="background-image: url('../images/atTheRuins.jpg');"></div>
    <p>You take your ship to the right into the thick fog. The loch narrows and the skies darken. 

        You ended up in the ruins. The whole place feels haunted, you whispered to yourself. 
        
        You decide to camp, you burn the candles and check the bag. 
        
        You wrap yourself in her cloaks, bite into the shortbread and sip your iron brew. 
        
        You open one of her books and start reading, the stories of you both, 
        
        you feel your heart is heavy and then you drift to sleep, beside haggis, dreaming of her. 
        
        You then wake up and continue your journey
