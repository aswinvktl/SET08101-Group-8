    <h4>fight them</h4>
    <p>F YOU CHOSE B, Then after fighting, you try hard, you defeat them, but they use their bomb to blind you and then they sink your ship, none win, but you cant make it in time so youre done, 
        You were brave â€” but not wise.
        GAME OVER, never make a decision based on fear, always think.
