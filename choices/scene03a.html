    <h4>You chose to explore the druid's glen</h4>
    <p>You choose to explore. You foot step onto the mossy path, your boots sink slightly. Haggis accompanies you.

        You walk around and find an old carving in a tree, of a woman in chains, face unfinished, beside a monster. Darkness falls into your eyes.
        
        As you sit beneath the tree, your hand brushes something cold beneath the leaves.
        
        You dig gently.
        
        A **compass**.
        
        Its surface is scratched, its dial strange it does not point north.
        
        It points to something else.
        
        **Truth, perhaps. Or fate.**
        
        You slip it into your pocket,

        you keep sailing, with resources and motive
