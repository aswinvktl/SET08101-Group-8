    <h4>The Voice</h4>
    <p>You have arrived where you have to be. 

        The loch is still, you steer towards the sound. 
        
        On your way, you hear something, 
        
        you ignore it,
        
        you hear it again
        
        Its a song, its her song, its her voice, its her.
        
        Soft. Singing. Echoing through the trees and the water and the wind.
        
        Closer now. Not a memory. Not a dream
        
        You feel like she's there. 
        
        you can either follow the song or the sound of the monster, you look at haggis, heâ€™s confused
    </p>
    <p>Choice 8</p>
    <p>Follow the song</p>
    <p>Follow the monster</p>
