    <h4>The Monster</h4>
    <p>You arrive in silence.

        The ship glides through the water, as if it is being pulled. 
        
        And now you see it, The monster, the loch ness monster.
        It coils through the shallows like a river come alive vast, dark, ancient. Its body glimmers faintly, scales like stones beneath moonlight. Its eyes are as old as the mountains.
        
        Then you see your wife, tied in magical light, its not chains, its light. You see her, but she doesn’t see you. 
        
        you freeze
        
        Haggis growls. 
        
        Not a warning, not a bark, A signal, a big signal.
        
        He steps to the bag and paws at it, you open the bag, the iron brew is glowing - brighter than ever
        
        You drink it
        It floods your limbs with fire strength and clarity. The ache, the grief, the years they burn away.
        
        Then haggis growls again
        
        ”what is it, boy?” you whisper.
        
        He looks at you, then at the drink and then at himself, like he’s trying to talk to you. 
        
        The moon is almost turning blue, you have to act quick.
        
        You have to decide
