      "You thanked everyone and started your expedition.",
      "By evening, the ship had left the valley behind. Mist moved like ghosts across the water. The day was coming to an end. The sails creaked softly.",
      "The sails stretched above him as the loch shimmered with fading light. Bruhaven disappeared behind mist and memory.",
      "Below deck, the ship creaked with quiet familiarity. The King stepped into the small cabin, the air still carrying the scent of her cloak.",
      "Something caught his eye — a glimpse of brown leather beneath a folded blanket.",
      "He reached down slowly…",
      "The bag.",
      "The same one he’d left behind.",
      "He stared at it. Frowned.",
      "“Impossible,” he whispered. “I said no.”",
      "A soft shuffle. A low, casual bark.",
      "Haggis sat nearby, tail wagging, tongue out, eyes full of innocent mischief.",
      "The King blinked… then smiled.",
      "“Of course. Of course it was you, you naughty boy.”",
      "He knelt, ruffled Haggis’s ears, and opened the bag. Iron Brew, shortbread, candles, her cloak, her book. All of it.",
      "“You never really leave anything behind, do you?”",
      "He stood, slung the bag over his shoulder, and looked toward the prow of the ship.",
      "The journey had only just begun - but he’s not empty handed.",
      "Suddenly, a split in the water appeared two diverging paths. Your map glowed faintly, but offered no clarity.",
      "To the left lay the realm of the dwarves, whispered of in old tales.",
      "To the right, nothing but shadow and uncertainty."
