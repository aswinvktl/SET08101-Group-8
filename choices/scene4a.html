    <title>JUMP</title>
    <h4>You decide to jump to the water</h4>
    <p>*You leap to the water, she is swimming away, you swim behind her. Before you realise, you are surrounded by multiple woman who look like her. It was an illusion. It was a group of kelpies- the shapeshifting seals* 

        *You try to swim upstairs, they attack you. You use your sword to fight them. You eventually win, heavily wounded and tired. You regret your decision. 
        
        You have lost time, strength and maybe hope.
        
        Because you wasted so much time, you donâ€™t make it in before the blue moon, so you wander in the lake, full of regret - YOU FAIL*</p>
