    <h4>The puzzle</h4>
    <p>The loch narrows once again, you end up in front of a massive stone gate. 

        You knock the door. A block of stone rises from the water beneath you, nearly sinks your ship. 
        
        It has a puzzle on it, with ancient symbols, some sharp, some round, some with stones. 
        
        The only way to move forward is to solve the puzzle.
