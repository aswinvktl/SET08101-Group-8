    <title>Her Voice</title>
        <h4>Her voice</h4>
        <p>If you choose her voice, you step off the ship and walk towards the sound. It leads you through a thicket of trees and dripping with moonlight. The path narrows. 

            You see her, standing in a pool of water. You hear her saying “Save me” you run towards her, as you are about to touch her hand, she disappears, it was an illusion. 
            
            The monsters companions the ghosts made a trap for you, you fell for it and you forever wander in the forest

        <p>GAME OVER</p>
