    <title>The Unicorn</title>
    <h4>Unicorn</h4>
    <p>You sailed the entire day. The sun never quite shone — not truly — but it lingered behind the mist like a watchful eye.

        The moon slowly starts to rise from the horizon, its not there yet, but it will be-soon. 
        
        And then — something changed.
        
        The air shimmered.
        
        The loch stilled to glass.
        
        And **Haggis** began to howl.
        
        Not out of fear.
        
        Out of something else.
        
        You turned — and saw **light**.
        
        A beam, brighter than the moon, split the mist.
        
        From it stepped a creature of dream:
        
        **A Unicorn.**
        
        They exist? You wonder. It watches you. Haggis looks happy.
        
        You remember from queens journal. 
        
        “when the sky shines
        
        and the loch reflects
        
        you follow the signs
        
        they lead to the rest”
        
        The unicorn turns, and starts to move forward. Your map glows, In a different direction.
