        *Raise the sword one last time — and drive it through the creature's skull.*
        
        *The loch erupts in a pillar of golden light.*
        
        *The curse shatters.*
        
        *The skies clear.*
        
        *It is finished.*
        
        *You turn to her — and she is already walking to you.*
        
        *She takes your hand.*
        
        > *“You did it,” she says.*
        > 
        > 
        > *“But you didn't have to do it alone.”*
        > 
        
        *Haggis, now a dog once more, trots toward you, tail wagging.*
        
        *You smile.*
        
        *Together, you sail home.*
