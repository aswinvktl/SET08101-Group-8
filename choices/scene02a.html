      <p>You decide to go left. You raise the Stock and Horn, made by ebony and cow horns, and blow it gently — saying you mean no harm, like a coded message.</p>

      <p>The torches light up and the stone door grinds open. The Dwarves appear. You offer them the shortbread (if choice 1a) and they offer you shelter. (If not, they still offer you shelter.)</p>

      <p>They feed you and give you a place to rest your head. The old granny dwarf sits beside the fire and recites riddles. You vaguely listen, but your eyelids are heavy.</p>

      <p>“I am so simple that I can only point, yet I guide men all over the world.”</p>

      <p>You sleep well. In the morning, they offer you a present: A basket-hilted sword, forged with runes that glow near cursed creatures.</p>

      <p>“This shall help — or at least, give you a choice!” said the dwarf king as he waved goodbye to you.</p>
