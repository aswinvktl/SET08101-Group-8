      <p>You decide to go left. You raise the Stock and Horn, made of ebony and cow horns, and blow it gently — a coded message of peace.</p>

      <p>The torches flare and the stone door grinds open. Dwarves appear. You offer them the shortbread (if you had it), but they welcome you warmly either way.</p>

      <p>They feed you, offering you shelter. An old granny dwarf sits beside the fire, reciting riddles. Your eyelids grow heavy.</p>

      <blockquote>"I am so simple that I can only point, yet I guide men all over the world."</blockquote>

      <p>You sleep soundly. In the morning, they gift you a basket-hilted sword, engraved with glowing runes to ward off cursed beings.</p>

      <p>"This shall help — or at least, give you a choice!" says the dwarf king, waving goodbye.</p>
