    <h2>Take the bag</h2>
    <h4>You chose the take the bag</h4>
    <p>You take the bag</p>
    <p>The bag has supplies. Bottles of iron brew to quinch your thirst and provide you with knowledge.
        Some warm shortbreads, freshly baked to satisfy your hunger. Candles to bring you light and warmth.
        An old stock-and-horn for him to signal.The queens warm cloaks for the weather.
        And perhaps, the most important her journal, words of magic.
