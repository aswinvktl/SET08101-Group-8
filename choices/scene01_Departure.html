      <h2>The Departure</h2>
      <p>
        Bruhaven woke up to smoke and sorrow.
        <br><br>
        You stood at the edge of the loch, wrapped in the queen's cloak. Your ship waited in the water, its sail stitched by her own hands.
        <br><br>
        Around you stood your people, quiet, hollow-eyed.
        <br><br>
        Your soldiers offered company, but you knew you had to do it alone — the path only you could walk.
        <br><br>
        As you turned to leave, the village elders came forth, carrying a great leather bag. Heavy with contents, stitched with care.
        <br><br>
        “You'll need this,” said them softly. “It has something, some hers, some ours. All of it matters.”
        <br><br>
        You gripped the strap, feeling its weight. It would slow you. But it might save you.
