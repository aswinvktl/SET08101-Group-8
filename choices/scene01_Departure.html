    <title>Scene 1: The Gift</title>
    <h2>The Departure</h2>
    <p>Bruhaven woke up to smoke and sorrow. 

        You stood at the edge of the loch, wrapped in the queen’s cloak. Your ship waited in the water, its sail stitched by her own hands.
        
        Around you stood your people, quiet, hollow-eyed. 
        
        Your soldiers offered company, but you knew you had to do it alone, the path only you could walk. 
        
        As you turned to leave, the village elders came forth, carrying a great leather bag. Heavy with contents, stitched with care.
        
        “You’ll need this” said them softly. “It has something, some hers, some ours. All of it matters”
        
        You gripped the strap, feeling its weight. It would slow you. But it might save you.
