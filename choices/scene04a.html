    <h4>You decide to jump to the water</h4>

    <p>*You leap to the water, she is swimming away, you swim behind her. Before you realise, you are surrounded by multiple woman who look like her. It was an illusion. It was a group of kelpies- the shapeshifting seals* 

        *You try to swim upstairs, they attack you. You use your sword to fight them. You eventually lose, you are outnumbered. You are dragged to the bottom of the loch, you see her face, she is smiling at you. You are drowning, you can't breathe. You are dead.*
