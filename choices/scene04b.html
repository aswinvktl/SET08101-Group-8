    <h4>Throw something</h4>
    <p>You throw an empty flask at the figure, the water ripples and you see the truth- its a selkie. The selkie, a mythical creature that can shapeshift, that inhabits the lochs and glens. 

        Its good that you didnâ€™t jump. Haggis was correct. you pat him.
        
        You sail on, quiet, alert. 
        
        Haggis is beside you, with eyes on the water. </p>
