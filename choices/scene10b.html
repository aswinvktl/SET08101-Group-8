    <p>*IF you listen to her,

        yes, my love, what is it? 
        
        She nods, gets her book and rises into the air. Pages fly open and she raises both her hands and speaks a language that hasnt been spoken in a thousand years.
        
        The monster pauses, looks at her and dissapears, becomes part of light and mist, its curse is lifted by her magic,
        
        No death, no blood. only mercy. 
        
        She lands gently, you embrace her, haggis jumps on top of you two.
        
        Thank you she says, Always and forever you whispier.*
        
        Then you go home.
