    <h4>Read book</h4>
    <p>he correct answer is to use her book, itâ€™s a test of  if you actually read her books or if you remember her conversations or if you actually know her. 
        
        this is when all it matters. You go to the section of love and see the same symbols, they represent emotions, you turn them accordingly. 
        
        AND BOOM!! The puzzle freezes and the gates open, a warm breeze flows through, haggis runs around you with joy, 
        
        you know her, you used her knowledge. You solved the puzzle with her memory, her magic and not just your intuition

        The gates open and you keep sailing
