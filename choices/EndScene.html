    <h4>The End</h4>
    <p>You return to Bruhaven.

        The fires are long gone.
        
        The valley breathes again.
        
        You are no longer just a King.
        
        She is no longer just a Queen.
        
        You are legend.
        
        And the loch remembers.
        
        Forever.
