    <h4>Listen to the dog</h4>
    <p>You kneel, you tilt the bottle towards the dog, as if it was asking for some. he drinks
        and then - light erupts
        
        The dog's body lifts from the deck - paws outstreched. 
        His fur glows gold and red, and his body expands
        Muscle. Bone. Magic. 
        
        He lands with a rumble and he's no longer a dog.
        
        A Highland Bull. eyes glowing orange. Horns hold golden fire. The guarding of old magic, the guardian of the queen.</p>
