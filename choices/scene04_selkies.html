    <title>THE SELKIES</title>
    <h4>The selkies</h4>
    <p>The sun is halfway through its daily journey, a journey the sun has to do everyday, till eternity. 

        You are cruising in your ship, following the map - vague but useful. 
        
        As you move forward, you see something on the water, a reflection, perhaps someone swimming??
        
        Curious, you move your ship towards the sight. Haggis growls low, like he’s uncertain. 
        
        You step to the edge to see what it is
        
        You see her - her blue eyes locked with yours, her brown hair wet, clinging to her face, her cloak torn. It’s her, your queen. 
        
        She opens her arms, asking you to rescue her. 
        
        You are ready to jump, haggis tugs your cloaks and tries to stop you….
        
        You don’t know what to do.
    </p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    <p>a. Jump into the water and save her</p>
    <p>Throw something to test the illusion</p>
