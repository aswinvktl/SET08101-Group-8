        <title>Premise 2: Royalty</title>

        <h4>Part 1: The Queen</h4>
        <p>She was the soul of Bruhaven, a whisper of beauty beyond the valley's green.
            Her eyes, a brilliant blue, shimmered like a sacred loch, kissed by the moon's soft sheen.
            Her hair, rich and brown like Highland soil, fell in soft waves, carrying the scent of wild herbs and distant rain. 
            Lost in ancient scripts and gardens bright, she wrote words for days to come. Old songs she sang, her fingers danced on the clarsach's strings, 
            making the valley hum. Even the wind, flowing free, would pause to hear her play.
            At times, she trained beside the soldiers, her blade light and fast, her braid swinging with purpose.
            For those who knew her, she was more than a queen, magic in human sway.</p>

            <h4>Part 2: The King</h4>
            <p>At her side stood the King, a warrior of rare spirit, noble in heart and bound by honour.
                Legends speak of his strength: enduring as the mountains that cradled the valley, and of a gentleness that softened even the fiercest winds.
                He was both shield and shelter. He led not with command, but with the quiet weight of love and purpose.
                In his gaze lived devotion. In his silence, unwavering truth.
                
                He adored her not with words, but through actions:
                Tending her garden when she was busy, restoring the strings of her harp, tucking notes into the pages of her books.
                
                Together, they were Bruhaven's harmony.</p>

                <h4>Part 3: Haggis</h4>
                <p>- The king and queen loved each other so dearly, they were rarely seen apart. 
                    Whether walking the garden paths or reading beneath the willow trees, 
                    their time together was sacred—soft, slow, and full of quiet joy. 
                    Only one soul dared to interrupt their peace: Haggis, 
                    the little dog with a nose for mischief and a heart of gold. 
                    Always with them. Always watching. Was it just a companion? Or something more than fur and bark? 
                    That, we shall one day find out…</p>
