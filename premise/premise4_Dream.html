    <title>Premise 4: Dream</title>

    <h4>Part 1: The next day</h4>
    <p>The village lay in ashes, its once-beautiful homes reduced to black and grey ruins.
        Though grief weighed heavy upon him, the king alongside his loyal troops moved among the broken, aiding the needy and calming the fearful. 
        His arms remained strong, but his heart was quietly breaking. When night at last descended, he returned to his bed alone and sleep took him.
        Not by choice, but by sheer exhaustion. And as the darkness deepened, an unusual dream began to stir…</p>

    <h4>Part 2: The Dream</h4>
    <p>- A strong glow boomed within his dream. A fairy - she spoke of a curse long whispered in the shadows of bruhaven, the tale of the loch ness monster. Exactly like his mother’s lullabies. 

        The beast, she said, awaited for a woman of rare beauty; hair as brown as chocolate and eyes as blue as the sky. It would take her, consume her and break its curse. And now that woman.. was his queen.. his other half.
        - The monster had awakened, and the queen had been taken to break its curse. If he did not act before the rise of the full blue moon, she would be lost to it forever.
        - The fairy warned him: he must go alone. No warriors. Only his companion the little white dog. Then, with a shimmer of her hand, she drew a map into the air glowing lines across darkness, marking the path he must follow. And just like that, the dream began to fade…
        - He gasped and wake up from the dream. He felt unease and loneliness. But he was no longer uncertain. 
        He would not let her vanish into legend.
        He would find her.
        And bring her home.</p>
