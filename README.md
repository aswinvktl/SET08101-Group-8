## üåç Overview

The website features a shared homepage that links to four interactive Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) stories. Each one was created by a different group member and explores different themes and styles.

The main page acts as the central directory. It was built collaboratively by the group, while each individual adventure was created independently.
