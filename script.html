        <h3>Part 1: The Premise</h3>
        <p>The game begins when the player clicks ‚ÄúPlay Now‚Äù from the homepage.</p>
        <p>They are taken to a new screen. It is silent. Wide. A slow panoramic shot moves across the loch, the cliffs, the trees. The world feels still, as if it is waiting.</p>
        <p>Then, the story begins.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-section">
        <h3>Part 2: The Wide Shot</h3>
        <p>Long ago, nestled beside mist-draped lochs and cliffs worn by time, there was a village whispered about in old stories.</p>
        <p>Its name was Bruhaven, or Gleann Bhru in the older tongue.</p>
        <p>A place passed down through fireside tales, where wind carried the scent of heather and hills hummed with secrets. The kind of place that might slip from memory if not spoken aloud often enough.</p>
        <p>Bruhaven was not on any map. It lived in memory, where all real magic begins.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-section">
        <h3>Part 3: The People</h3>
        <p>The people of Bruhaven were kind. They shared what they had and wanted little more.</p>
        <p>Children ran between the trees and helped their elders dye tartan. Some carved stories into stone. Others herded Highland coos along the ridges or pressed wildflowers into old books.</p>
        <p>The village was not rich or grand, but it was full ‚Äî full of music, full of sky, full of people who looked after one another.</p>
        <p>Time passed slowly there, the way it does in places the world forgets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-section">
        <h3>Part 4: The Iron Brew</h3>
        <p>What truly made Bruhaven distinct was the potion that came from its land.</p>
        <p>It was bright, orange-gold, and sweet with a strange fizz that danced on the tongue. They called it Iron Brew.</p>
        <p>No one really knew where it came from. Some said the soil was enchanted. Others said it was crafted by old alchemists who had long since disappeared into the hills.</p>
        <p>It gave strength. It gave laughter. It healed aching limbs and lifted heavy hearts.</p>
        <p>To outsiders, it might have looked like a drink. But to Bruhaven, it was tradition. It was ceremony. It was joy in a cup.</p>
        <p>The villagers raised it to celebrate. They drank it before a journey. They kept it close and never wasted a drop.</p>
        <p>It was their magic.</p>
