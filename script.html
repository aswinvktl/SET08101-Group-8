    <h1>üìú Full Story: <em>Loch Ness Monster: Expedition</em></h1>

    <div class="story-section">
        <h3>Part 1: The Premise</h3>
        <p>The game begins when the player clicks ‚ÄúPlay Now‚Äù from the homepage.</p>
        <p>They are taken to a new screen. It is silent. Wide. A slow panoramic shot moves across the loch, the cliffs, the trees. The world feels still, as if it is waiting.</p>
        <p>Then, the story begins.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-section">
        <h3>Part 2: The Wide Shot</h3>
        <p>Long ago, nestled beside mist-draped lochs and cliffs worn by time, there was a village whispered about in old stories.</p>
        <p>Its name was Bruhaven, or Gleann Bhru in the older tongue.</p>
        <p>A place passed down through fireside tales, where wind carried the scent of heather and hills hummed with secrets. The kind of place that might slip from memory if not spoken aloud often enough.</p>
        <p>Bruhaven was not on any map. It lived in memory, where all real magic begins.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-section">
        <h3>Part 3: The People</h3>
        <p>The people of Bruhaven were kind. They shared what they had and wanted little more.</p>
        <p>Children ran between the trees and helped their elders dye tartan. Some carved stories into stone. Others herded Highland coos along the ridges or pressed wildflowers into old books.</p>
        <p>The village was not rich or grand, but it was full ‚Äî full of music, full of sky, full of people who looked after one another.</p>
        <p>Time passed slowly there, the way it does in places the world forgets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-section">
        <h3>Part 4: The Iron Brew</h3>
        <p>What truly made Bruhaven distinct was the potion that came from its land.</p>
        <p>It was bright, orange-gold, and sweet with a strange fizz that danced on the tongue. They called it Iron Brew.</p>
        <p>No one really knew where it came from. Some said the soil was enchanted. Others said it was crafted by old alchemists who had long since disappeared into the hills.</p>
        <p>It gave strength. It gave laughter. It healed aching limbs and lifted heavy hearts.</p>
        <p>To outsiders, it might have looked like a drink. But to Bruhaven, it was tradition. It was ceremony. It was joy in a cup.</p>
        <p>The villagers raised it to celebrate. They drank it before a journey. They kept it close and never wasted a drop.</p>
        <p>It was their magic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-section">
        <h3>Part 5: The Queen</h3>
        <p>She was the soul of Bruhaven, a whisper of warmth beneath the valley‚Äôs green.</p>
        <p>Her eyes were a blue so vivid it caught the breath. Not soft like summer skies, but deep and clear, like a loch beneath frost, shimmering with the weight of something older than memory. They held both storm and stillness, a gaze that could steady a child or silence a council hall.</p>
        <p>Her hair, a dark chestnut rich as Highland earth in autumn, fell in soft waves across her back. Most days she tied it with a ribbon of forest green, though always a few strands escaped, curling at her cheeks like ivy reaching for light.</p>
        <p>She wandered through the gardens at first light, murmuring to herbs as if they understood. By afternoon, she would vanish into the forest paths, barefoot and unhurried, with a satchel of pressed flowers, maps, and half-written pages.</p>
        <p>When the shadows stretched long, she returned to her library. Among shelves of oak and flickering lamps, she wrote.</p>
        <p>She wrote of magic, old and quiet, the kind that slips between seasons and lives in stories passed from voice to voice. She wrote of love, of memory, of things so gentle they could not be spoken aloud. Her journals were spells in disguise.</p>
        <p>She taught the children the names of stars, the roots of words, and the secrets of the weather. Even the elders leaned in, pretending not to listen, though they always did.</p>
        <p>In the evenings, her clarsach rang through the glen. Her fingers danced along the strings, weaving notes that tasted of honey and wind. Sometimes the birds paused to listen. Sometimes the wind did too.</p>
        <p>Some evenings, she sparred with the soldiers. Her blade was fast, her footwork clean. She could knock the weight from a warrior‚Äôs hand with the tilt of her wrist and still make it back in time to stir the evening stew.</p>
        <p>She was not a queen because she wore a crown. She was a queen because she was trusted, because she was followed, because she was loved.</p>
        <p>She was strength without cruelty, grace without fear, knowledge without pride.</p>
        <p>She was, in every sense, magic in human form.</p>

            <div class="story-section">
        <h3>Part 7: Haggis</h3>
        <p>Their days were full, but their hearts never tired. Wherever the Queen and King wandered, a small shape followed ‚Äî four paws, a wagging tail, and eyes too wise for their size.</p>
        <p>His name was Haggis.</p>
        <p>A black Skye Terrier, with ears that stood like watchtowers and a nose that found trouble faster than it found food. He was curious, loyal, and terribly nosy.</p>
        <p>He was not a royal hound by blood, nor did he come with papers. One day, he simply arrived. Wet from the rain, covered in leaves, and completely unbothered by the guards who tried to shoo him away.</p>
        <p>The Queen had smiled. The King had sighed. And that was that.</p>
        <p>From then on, he was always there. At their heels, at their fire, at the edge of every moment.</p>
        <p>He would sleep under the Queen‚Äôs desk while she wrote, occasionally snoring through entire chapters. He would trot behind the King during patrols, growling at shadows and rabbits alike.</p>
        <p>He was brave in ways only dogs can be. Loud when things were silent. Silent when things fell apart.</p>
        <p>Some believed he was just a dog. Others, especially the children, whispered that he was more. A creature touched by magic. A guardian in disguise.</p>
        <p>In one of her journals, the Queen had written:</p>
        <p><em>‚ÄúSome beasts guard homes. Others guard hearts. I think Haggis might do both.‚Äù</em></p>
        <p>He had never left her side.</p>
        <p>And when she vanished, he did not whimper.</p>
        <p>He waited.</p>
        <p>And when the King began his journey, it was Haggis who stepped aboard first.</p>
        <p>As if he had always known where the path would lead.</p>
