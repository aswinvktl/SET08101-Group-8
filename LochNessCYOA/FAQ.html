    <h1>üìÉ FAQ: Behind the Scenes of <em>Loch Ness Monster: Expedition</em></h1>
    <p>This FAQ explores the ideas, inspirations, and cultural choices behind the creation of the game. From myth to memory, each answer offers insight into how the story came to life.</p>
    <hr>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Etymology of "Bruhaven"</h3>
        <p>The name blends ‚ÄúIrn Bru,‚Äù the iconic Scottish soft drink, with the word ‚Äúhaven,‚Äù meaning a place of refuge. It was designed to feel both mythical and distinctly Scottish, drawing from local culture and a sense of emotional safety.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>"Iron Brew" as a character</h3>
        <p>Irn Bru is widely regarded as Scotland's most famous drink. In the game, it becomes a symbolic source of strength and energy, almost a magical elixir. The idea was to turn an everyday cultural icon into a fantastical tool, not to reflect folklore directly but to show creative reinterpretation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why is the Queen described as having blue eyes and brown hair?</h3>
        <p>This decision was based on demographic research. Around 57 percent of people in Edinburgh have blue eyes, one of the highest rates in the UK, and brown is the most common hair colour in Scotland. As a foreigner seeing these traits repeatedly, they stood out as defining features of local identity. The Queen was designed to reflect this ordinary but striking appearance, grounding her in realism.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Why is the Queen always seen wearing green?</h3>
      <p>Green is one of my favourite colours, and to me it has always felt both royal and rooted. More importantly, it is the colour of Celtic Football Club, Scotland's most famous team. The Queen's attire is a subtle tribute to that cultural icon. I even visited the stadium during development, and the atmosphere stayed with me throughout the writing process. It became a quiet symbol of pride, place, and spirit. <br>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How is the queen different in Loch Ness Monster: Expedition?</h3>
      <p>In many games, the Queen is just someone to rescue, a symbol of loss or motivation. I wanted to avoid that. This Queen was written with care, shaped as a scholar, a warrior, and a magician, without forcing her into modern clich√©s. She is curious, clever, and central. The story is not just about saving her, it is about understanding her.</p>
  </div>
  
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why is the King portrayed as a non-traditional character?</h3>
        <p>The King was intentionally written to challenge stereotypes. He is strong but also emotionally expressive and thoughtful. His power lies in compassion and partnership, rather than control. This allows him to stand as an equal to the Queen, promoting a balanced and modern portrayal of masculinity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is the significance of the dog?</h3>
        <p>The dog Haggis was inspired by Greyfriars Bobby, a real Skye Terrier known for his loyalty. Choosing a black Skye Terrier links the story to Edinburgh's heritage. The name ‚ÄúHaggis‚Äù adds local warmth and familiarity. Haggis evolves into more than a companion, he represents emotional memory and later becomes something magical.

    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why does the dog turn into a Highland bull?</h3>
        <p>Highland cows are iconic in Scottish imagery. But having a "Highland bull" makes it fantastical and it also keeps the fantasy rooted in national symbols.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is in the bag, and what does it represent</h3>
        <p>The bag contains Iron Brew, shortbread, a cloak, journal, candles, and a stock and horn ‚Äî each symbolising comfort, identity, or storytelling. As a foreigner collecting visual cues from Scotland, these items represent a playful but sincere reflection of cultural perception.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why include selkies and blue men?</h3>
        <p>Selkies are creatures from Scottish and Orkney folklore who transform between seal and human form. Including them helps root the fantasy in real mythology.
        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selkie" target="_blank">WikiPedia - Selkies in Scottish Myth</a>)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Puzzles and future development?</h3>
        <p>Puzzles reflect the Queen's scholarly background and are meant to grow in importance as the game develops. They create deeper engagement, asking the player to understand her intellect, not just follow her story. Also, in future versions, I plan to create in game puzzles within the CYOA using react.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why is there a unicorn?</h3>
        <p>Scotland's national animal is the unicorn. It's such a unique choice that I felt it would be interesting to include in the story.</p>
    </div>
    

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why is the final scene set at Loch Ness?</h3>
        <p>Loch Ness is internationally recognised as a site of legend. Setting the finale there ties the game to global perceptions of Scottish myth. The Loch Ness Monster is portrayed not as evil but as ancient, mysterious, and misunderstood, much like the nature of folklore itself.

    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why can the player choose whether to kill the monster?</h3>
        <p>This choice is the emotional core of the story. It allows players to decide what kind of ruler the King becomes, one who destroys or one who listens. The Queen offers a peaceful alternative, showing that wisdom and compassion can be just as powerful as bravery.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Why does the game feature fiddle, harp, and cello music?</h3>
      <p>I've always had a love for classical music. The fiddle, harp, and cello are not only powerful in their own right, but they also have deep roots in Scottish musical tradition. Including them was both a personal and cultural choice, a way to honour the mood of the story and the place it's set in. There is always looping tracks of cello, harp and violin throughout the game </p>
  </div>
  

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Fun fact about the creation of this story!!</h3>
        <p>This story was shaped through the eyes of someone discovering Scotland for the first time. Observations, myths, and local encounters were reimagined into fantasy. It is a blend of books, films, and most importantly personal experience and daily observations. The project is as much about perception and cultural wonder as it is about magic.
